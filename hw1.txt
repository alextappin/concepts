1) Reservered words in c are the following: 
auto,       else,   long,       switch, 
break,      enum,	register,   typedef,
case,	    extern,	return,     union,
char,	    float,	short,	    unsigned,
const,	    for,    signed,	    void,
continue,	goto,	sizeof,     volatile,
default,	if,	    static,	    while,
do,	int,	struct,_Packed,     double

2) One method of finding the size of register r would be to see the biggest
number you could store into it. Another method would be to shift the bits until 
you found that there were no more bits to shift

3) a=0 b=1 c=2
d = a XOR a
d = b >> b
d = b * a
d = a / c
